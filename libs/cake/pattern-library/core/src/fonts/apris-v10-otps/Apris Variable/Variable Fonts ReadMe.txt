VARIABLE FONTS

Thanks for purchasing a Schick Toikka font collection! This package contains also a variable version of the font.

A variable font provides a range of dynamic font variations for a typeface in a single file. While static fonts can only contain one font per file, a variable font can contain many.

Please note that variable font technology has limited support.

Since the specs might change and the technology is ever evolving, testing is key to make sure the font displays and behaves as expected. There might still be undiscovered quirks and edge cases that need to be worked around.
